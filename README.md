ABOUT
------------

This project was created using React.js and Redux.

When I was planning out my four years of study, I found myself repeatedly looking at my school's academic planner, searching for the program requirements and course definitions when deciding on the courses I wanted to take. I figured creating an application that would inform users visually about the courses they need to complete to fulfill their degree would not only be beneficial to me but to other students as well. That being said, this project is fully live and functional at www.uoftplanner.com
